## âœ… Contribution Checklist
Please confirm that you've met the following criteria before submitting your contribution:

- [ ] **Widespread Recognition:** The brand has widespread recognition and is suitable for the core LittleLink repository (most additions belong in [LittleLink Extended](https://github.com/sethcottle/littlelink-extended)).  
- [ ] **Brand Styling Guidelines:** Youâ€™ve followed the brand's official styling guidelines (if available).  
- [ ] **Consistent Styling:** If no guidelines exist, the button style is consistent with the brand's public image (e.g., website, social media).  
- [ ] **Icon Clarity:** The brand's logo/icon is clear and recognizable in a 24x24px format.  
   - [ ] If the primary logo doesnâ€™t scale well, youâ€™ve adapted it using the brandâ€™s social media avatar or favicon while maintaining the essence of the original logo.  
   - [ ] The icon is provided in `.svg` format.  
- [ ] **Theme Testing:** You've tested the button against both light and dark themes:  
   - [ ] Manually swapped `theme-auto.css` with `theme-light.css` and `theme-dark.css` in `index.html` to check contrast or used [LittleLink Button Builder](https://builder.littlelink.io) contrast checker.
   - [ ] Added a `#000000`/`#FFFFFF` stroke if necessary to improve contrast and accessibility. [LittleLink Button Builder](https://builder.littlelink.io) will automatically recommend when to add a stroke.  
- [ ] **Accessibility Compliance:** The button's background and text colors meet visual accessibility standards (unless it contradicts brand guidelines).  
- [ ] **Alphabetical Order:** Your contribution is alphabetically organized in `brands.css` and `index.html`.  
- [ ] **Button Preview:** You've added a button preview in `index.html`.  
- [ ] **Variant Naming Schema:** If adding a variant button (e.g., inverted color scheme):  
   - [ ] Naming follows the existing pattern (`[Brand Name] Alt` and `.button-brandname-alt`).  
   - [ ] Any additional icons are named according to `brandname-alt.svg` schema.  
- [ ] **Proper Capitalization:**  
   - [ ] In `brands.css`, the brand name comment follows `/* Brand Name */` format.  
   - [ ] Code uses lowercase for `.button.button-brandname`.  
   - [ ] In `index.html`, comments reflect `<!-- Brand Name -->` format.  
   - [ ] Button text and `alt` attributes match the brandâ€™s official capitalization.  
- [ ] **PR Details:**
